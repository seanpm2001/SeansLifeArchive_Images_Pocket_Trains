# SeansLifeArchive_Images_Pocket_Trains
 The module for my life story project that contains my Pocket Trains gameplay images.

***

## About

See above This repository hosts all my weekly Pocket Trains session pictures.

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I originally started playing Pocket Trains on iOS in 2013. I didn't have much interest in the game at the time and I stopped playing pretty quickly (on the same day of installation)

In 2020, with my NimbleBit fan phase, I started playing Pocket Trains again. I still play on a weekly basis. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.pockettrains&hl=en_US&gl=US).
