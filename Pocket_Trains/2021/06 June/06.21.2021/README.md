# Pocket Trains session June 21st 2021

I had an very long session today, and eventually forced myself to quit. I made some progress today, and repaired several trains, going nearly bankrupt in the process.

## New railroads

I did not build any new railroads today, and I did not create any new engines or fuel cars.

## Bux

I saved up a little less bux compared to last week, as the game was giving me ads today, although I had diversity this time, diversity of bad ads. I made progress today on transporting 40 bux from Asia to North America.

## Asia exploration

I didn't explore Asia today,

## South America exploration

I didn't explore South America today.

## Oceania exploration

I did not do any exploring in Oceania today.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progress on this goal again today.

## Revenue

I did worse on revenue today.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level progress

I made some progress in level 14 today, surpassing 1.09 million total XP.
