# Pocket Trains session July 5th 2021

I had an very long session today, and eventually forced myself to quit. I made massive progress today, and did lots of train trips.

## New railroads

<!-- I did not build any new railroads today, and I did not create any new engines or fuel cars. !-->

I built a new railroad today, using a Rio Grande Standard train, fittingly at the capitol of Rio De Janeiro. This was much later into the session. I did not build any other trains tonight.

## Bux

I saved up a lot less bux compared to last week, as the game was giving me ads today, although I had diversity this time, diversity of bad ads. I earned over 150 bux in total today.

## Asia exploration

I didn't explore Asia today,

## South America exploration

I didn't explore South America today.

## Oceania exploration

I did not do any exploring in Oceania today.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progress on this goal again today.

## Revenue

I did well on revenue today, the bank transfer will hopefully boost me up once the rate becomes stable.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level progress

I made some progress in level 14 today, surpassing 1.187 million total XP.

## Overview

See above.
