# Pocket Trains session April 5th 2021

I had a long Pocket Trains session today and made a kilobit of progress.

## Level progress

I gained well over 20000 XP today, and made it closer to level 13.

## Region unlocks

I unlocked another region in North America, and worked on transporting American resources to Europe, Asia, and Africa.

## Trains

I wore most of my trains down today before quitting.

## Revenue

I had a bad day with revenue, with ups and downs, and no real progress on coins. Bux on the other hand, I stockpiled over 150 new bills today.

## Stockyard upgrades

I upgraded a few stockyards today.

## Overview

Todays session was long, but still shorter than the usual session, I made some progress, and had a good time.
