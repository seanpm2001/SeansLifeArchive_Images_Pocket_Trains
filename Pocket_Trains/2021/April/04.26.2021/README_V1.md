# Pocket Trains session April 26th 2021

I had an extremely long session today, and took a break during a car ride. I made significant progress today.

## New railroads

I did not build any new railroads today, although I want to, as I have 4 new railroad ideas I want to get done.

## Bux

I gained over 200 bux today. I am saving them up at the moment.

## Asia exploration

I explored some regions in Asia today, and partially visited some of them.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progresxs on this goal today.

## Revenue

I continued to struggle to make revenue today due to expenses, but I am starting to make a comeback on this. I am trying to save up for a new railroad, as I need a train that only works in China, as the Vanilla Steamer has some issues reaching various parts of China during my sessions. I picked out a dragonborn train for this, as it is a piece of Chinese culture, and it fits well.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level up

I leveled up to level 13 today, and uncrated over 10 crates total today.

## Overview

See above.
