# Pocket Trains session April 12th 2021

I had a normal Pocket Trains session today

## Revenue

I made lots of revenue today, and saved up over 1000 bux. I didn't have much revenue dropped.

## Europe

I didn't travel around in Europe as much as I normally do today.

## North America

I did some traveling in North America today.

## South America

I briefly traveled around in South America today

## Africa

I traveled around Africa a bit today.

## Oceania

I am not sure if I have any trains going through Oceania at the moment.

## Antarctica

This game currently doesn't allow travel in Antarctica.

## Asia

I made several trips around Asia, and unlocked Singapore today.

## Exchange rate

The exchange rate was really poor today, and I am saving up bux anyways, so I didn't exchange any bux for coins.

## Crates

I unboxed 3 crates today and got 2 unique pieces, and 1 common duplicate. I received 1 more crate later on.

## Overview

See above
