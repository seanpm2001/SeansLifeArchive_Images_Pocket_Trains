# Pocket Trains session April 19th 2021

I had a very long session today, and played during a technical support call (very minimally) and up until past 3:40 pm. This game is a bit of an addiction as well.

## New railroads

I did not build any new railroads today.

## Bux

I gained over 300 bux today. I am saving them up at the moment.

## Asia exploration

I explored some regions in Asia today, but didn't visit them.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa.

## Revenue

I continued to struggle to make revenue today due to expenses, but I am starting to make a comeback on this.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Overview

See above.
