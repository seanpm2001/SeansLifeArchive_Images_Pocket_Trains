# Pocket Trains session May 10th 2021

I had an extremely long session today, and eventually forced myself to quit. I made some progress, but it feels like the game is purposefully trying to screw me up, as every time I earn enough money to do anything fun (without using the bank) half my trains need repair.

## New railroads

I did not build any new railroads today.

## Bux

I saved up about 100 bux today.

## Asia exploration

I explored some regions in Asia today, and partially visited some of them. I am working on re-routing the Vanilla Steamer. Also, I put another engine onto my `Perm` -a-ban railway (I chose that name, as its first location is Perm, and I thought Permaban would be a funny term for it) so it can hold more shipments, but I still need to do a fuel upgrade on it.

## South America exploration

I briefly explored South America today and got used to my Rio Grande standard train.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progresxs on this goal today.

## Revenue

I continued to struggle to make revenue today due to expenses, but I didn't do well on this goal today.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level up

I did not level up today.

## Overview

See above.
