# Pocket Trains session May 24th 2021

I had an very long session today, and eventually forced myself to quit. I made some significant progress today but kept going down to low sums of money, due to ridiculous amount of repair.

## New railroads

I did not build any new railroads today, but I crafted 2 new engines.

## Bux

I didn't save up very much bux today. 

## Asia exploration

I didn't explore Asia today.

## South America exploration

I explored South America very briefly today.

## Oceania exploration

I did not do any exploring in Oceania today.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progress on this goal again today.

## Revenue

I continued to struggle to make revenue today due to repair expenses, but I didn't do well on this goal today.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level up

I did not level up today. I made significant progress on level 13 though.

## Overview

See above.
