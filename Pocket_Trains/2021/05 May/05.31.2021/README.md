# Pocket Trains session May 31st 2021

I had an very long session today, and eventually forced myself to quit. I made some progress today, and managed to gain more money, despite losing over 10000 to repair.

## New railroads

I did not build any new railroads today, and I did not create any new engines or fuel cars.

## Bux

I didn't save up very much bux today compared to last week.

## Asia exploration

I didn't explore Asia today.

## South America exploration

I didn't explore South America today.

## Oceania exploration

I did not do any exploring in Oceania today.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progress on this goal again today.

## Revenue

I did better on making revenue today, even after spending 10000 coins on repair.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level up

I leveled up to level 14 today, and made minor progress in level 14.

## Overview

See above.
