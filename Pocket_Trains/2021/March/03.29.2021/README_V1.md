# Pocket trains session March 29th 2021

I had a long but shorter Pocket Trains session today and made lots of progress.

## Train crates

I gained a few premium train crates today and unboxed them, but didn't get enough 

## Bux

I have been working on stocking up bux again. This time, I plan to always have at least 1000 on me. I also plan on opening train crates as I get them, and not holding it off.

I ended the session with 736 bux

## Coins

I got up past 26000 coins today, but bought a special train crate for 22000 coins. I ended the session with a little over 8000 coins.

## Level

I leveled up to level 12 today, and made little progress in the new level.

## Exploration

### Europe

No new territories in Europe were explored today.

### North America

No new territories in North America were explored today.

### South America

No new territories in South America were explored today.

### Asia

### Africa

### Oceania

### Antarctica

Antarctica is not present in this game at the moment.

## Railroads

10x railroads were present today, all of them making many trips.

### New railroads

I did not build any new railroads today

### Stockyards

No stock yard upgrades were done today.

### Fuel level

I drained all my trains fuel levels down to the point where they couldn't make any new stops today before ending my session, as I normally do.
