# Notes for the October 23rd 2020 Pocket Trains session

I finally got back into this game tonight. I played after 9:00 pm. The session was enjoyable, and I regained control of gameplay again.

Due to it being past 9:00 pm, I was hoping the game would have a night theme like Tiny Tower does at 8:00 pm. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It was still a fun session.
